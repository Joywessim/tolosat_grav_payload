### ==== TO DO LIST ====
Here is a non-exhaustive list of tasks that have to be done in ths code
* replace Lat/Long by theta/phi where needed
* find and write the right geoid undualation equation
* write the right acceleration and geopotential matrix when generating the false coordinates
* write the unctionsto derivate the position to find the acceleration
* adapt the code based on the desired census and geoid model
* recompute the import of coefficients properly
* modify init_grid to allow any boxed coordinates to make a map and focus on one zone
* add gridlines for Mollweide projection
