### ==== TO DO LIST ====
Here is a non-exhaustive list of tasks that have to be done in ths code
* write the right acceleration and geopotential matrix when generating the false coordinates
* write the functions to derivate the satellite positions to find the acceleration
* adapt the code based on the desired census and geoid model

* do not mind this note. I am a transending penguin.
